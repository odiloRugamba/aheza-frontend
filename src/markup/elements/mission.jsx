												Here at Aheza, we understand that people were affected by the genocide in many ways.
												Some suffer severe post-traumatic stress as a result of the events they witnessed, 
												many are struggling with grief at the loss of friends and family, some turn to alcohol 
												and drugs to cope with that loss.
											</p>
											<p>
												Even those who have successful careers and families of their own might experience depression 
												or unwanted thoughts from time to time, but feel as though they canâ€™t talk about it.
											</p>
											<p>
												Aheza is a safe space for anyone who needs a little support. Our qualified, trained staff are experienced 
												in dealing with the full range of conditions specific to genocide survivors. We provide group therapy sessions,
												one-on-one counseling and a range of holistic activities to compliment your recovery.
											</p>
											<p>
											We also provide career counseling and entrepreneur training. Many survivors find it difficult to secure a job and 
											remain in work due to mental and physical health issues. We assist individuals who are ready to work towards the 
											future, helping them to build skills and find a fulfilling career. Our job is to listen, understand and support.
