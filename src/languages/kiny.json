Another example: Many construction companies include a section about the environmental impacts of their work in their meeting reports. Additionally, if an executive transaction with a board member comes up for a vote, each attendeeâ€™s vote should be included in your board meeting report. So too should all information presented to attendees and the ultimate outcome of the vote. This documentation matters if the IRS requests documentation regarding corporate finances.",
